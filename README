Objective of project
Designed an intelligent pipeline for 72,000+ time series health readings including preprocessing, feature scaling, and
temporal structuring.
Developed an unsupervised anomaly detection module using One-Class SVM with an RBF kernel.
Built a multi-task LSTM model to jointly learn sequence reconstruction and anomaly classification.
Integrated SVM outputs, LSTM predictions, and reconstruction thresholds into a unified decision system for real-time
elderly care monitoring.
